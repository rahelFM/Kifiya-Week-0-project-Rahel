Report on Data Exploration and Cleaning for Solar Farm Data (Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo)
Objective:
The aim of today’s work was to begin exploring and analyzing solar farm data from three countries: Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The focus was primarily on understanding the dataset’s structure, identifying issues related to data display, handling missing values, and dealing with inappropriate zero and negative values.
Summary of Current Work:
1.	Dataset Overview: The dataset includes solar radiation data with multiple variables such as:
o	Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)
o	Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)
o	Ambient Temperature (Tamb)
o	Wind Speed (WS)
o	Precipitation
o	And more.
These measurements are captured over time with timestamps, and the data is categorized by country, which makes it essential to have a clean and structured dataset for analysis.
2.	Data Challenges Encountered: During the exploration, several issues were encountered that hindered further analysis:
o	Data Display Issues: The dataset did not display as expected when attempting to visualize the first few rows using df.head(). This could have been due to several reasons, including improper data conversion or issues with the Timestamp field.
o	Missing Values: The dataset contains missing values in both numeric and non-numeric columns (e.g., Country, Comments, and sensor readings like GHI, DHI, etc.). Missing values are a common issue in large datasets, and the decision was made to handle them by filling missing numeric values with the mean of the column. However, this method needs careful consideration in future analyses.
o	Zeros and Negative Values: Some of the values in critical columns, such as irradiance (GHI, DNI, DHI), were negative or zero, which are not valid in the context of solar radiation. These values could either represent invalid readings, sensor errors, or issues with data entry. Further, the ambient temperature (Tamb) and other meteorological factors showed some inconsistencies with expected values, such as unexpectedly high relative humidity and wind speeds that are not reflective of actual weather patterns.
3.	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Steps: To move forward with a valid analysis, the following steps were taken:
o	Handling Missing Values: 
	Missing values in numeric columns were imputed with the mean of the respective column using df.fillna(df.mean()).
	Non-numeric columns such as Country were imputed with a placeholder value ('Unknown').
o	Datetime Conversion: 
	The Timestamp column was converted to the datetime format using pd.to_datetime(df['Timestamp']). This step is critical for any time-based analysis, but invalid or misformatted timestamps may still exist in the dataset and need further cleaning.
o	Identifying Negative and Zero Values: 
	Negative values in columns like GHI, DNI, and DHI were flagged as invalid. These values were not expected in the context of solar radiation data and are likely the result of errors during data collection or processing.
	Zero values were also problematic, particularly in columns where they could not logically appear (e.g., DNI, GHI). In the next stages of cleaning, these values should either be removed, imputed, or corrected based on domain knowledge.
4.	Current Limitations:
o	Incomplete Data: Despite filling some missing values, the dataset still shows gaps in certain fields. Not all missing data can be simply imputed with the mean or median, especially for certain categorical fields or where domain-specific knowledge is needed to impute values properly.
o	Invalid Values: A significant number of negative and zero values remain in the data, especially for irradiance measurements. These will require domain expertise or a more sophisticated approach (e.g., using interpolation, validation against known thresholds, or cleaning based on sensor metadata) to handle correctly.
o	Data Size and Complexity: The dataset contains a large number of rows, and handling missing or erroneous data for all columns is challenging. As the dataset grows, more advanced techniques such as outlier detection, smoothing, and machine learning models for imputation may be required.
Conclusion and Next Steps:
Today's work was focused on data exploration and basic cleaning:
•	I tried to identify the presence of missing values, zeros, and negative values, which hindered proper analysis and visualization.
•	The cleaning process involved converting the Timestamp column to the proper datetime format and imputing missing values where appropriate. However, more sophisticated methods will be needed to fully prepare the data for analysis.
Next Steps:
1.	Advanced Imputation Methods: Implement more advanced data cleaning techniques to handle non-numeric missing values (e.g., for categorical data) and incorrect zeros and negative values.
2.	Outlier Detection: Apply outlier detection techniques to identify and address unrealistic sensor readings, such as negative irradiance or zero wind speed.
3.	Validation with Domain Knowledge: understand the domain for valid solar radiation readings and other meteorological variables.
4.	Data Visualization: Once the data is cleaned, I will proceed with more detailed descriptive analysis, including distribution plots, box plots, and correlations to understand key patterns in the data
