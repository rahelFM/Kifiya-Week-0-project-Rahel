1. Data Overview and Preprocessing
The dataset consists of solar radiation measurements from various regions in Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The data includes measurements such as:
•	Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI): Total solar radiation received per square meter on a horizontal surface.
•	Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI): Solar radiation received per square meter on a surface perpendicular to the sun's rays.
•	Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI): Solar radiation received on a horizontal surface that has been scattered by particles or clouds.
•	Ambient Temperature (Tamb): Temperature of the surrounding environment.
•	Wind Speed (WS): Wind speed at the location of the solar measurement.
•	Precipitation, Humidity, and Other Environmental Factors: Which could influence solar panel performance.
Each dataset is timestamped, ensuring that we can analyze the temporal changes in solar radiation and environmental factors over time.
Initial Observations:
•	Negative values: Some of the irradiance values (GHI, DNI, DHI) had negative values or zeros, which are physically impossible for irradiance data. These values were treated as invalid and replaced with NaN (Not a Number).
•	Missing Data: Some entries had missing or invalid values in columns like GHI, DNI, Tamb, etc., which were imputed using the mean of respective columns to ensure completeness of the dataset.
•	Data Types: Data was cleaned to ensure that the correct data types (e.g., numerical values for irradiance and temperature) were assigned to each column.

2. Descriptive Analysis of Key Variables
After preprocessing the data, the following key insights were extracted from the descriptive statistics for Benin (similar analysis was applied to Sierra Leone and Togo):
•	Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI): The average value of GHI indicates the amount of sunlight available in a given area. Higher GHI values suggest better solar farm potential.
•	Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI): DNI values are generally lower than GHI, but they are critical in identifying optimal regions for solar power generation as DNI directly impacts solar panels that track the sun.
•	Ambient Temperature (Tamb): The temperature affects the efficiency of solar panels, with higher temperatures often leading to lower performance due to thermal losses.
•	Wind Speed (WS): Higher wind speeds could influence the cleaning of the solar panels. They are an important environmental factor but do not directly impact solar panel performance.

3. Data Visualizations
To better understand the distribution of the variables, several visualizations were created:
•	Distribution of GHI, DNI, and Tamb:
The histogram and KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) plots for GHI and DNI highlight the spread of solar radiation values. From these plots, it can be observed that solar radiation values are not uniformly distributed, suggesting the presence of regions with higher potential for solar energy generation.
•	Ambient Temperature (Tamb):
The temperature data is crucial in understanding how environmental conditions might affect solar panel efficiency. The plots showed that ambient temperature values remain within typical tropical ranges.
•	Wind Speed (WS) and Wind Gusts (WSgust):
Wind speed was generally low, but sporadic high gusts were observed. Understanding wind speed variability is important for operations like cleaning and maintenance of solar panels.
•	Correlation Analysis:
The correlation heatmap revealed that GHI and DNI were positively correlated, as expected. Higher DNI values often coincide with higher GHI values, which is essential for evaluating solar energy production. Ambient temperature was negatively correlated with GHI and DNI, which may imply a reduction in solar efficiency during hotter periods.

4. Insights and Key Findings
•	High Solar Radiation Potential in Certain Regions:
Based on the distribution of GHI and DNI, certain regions of Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo show higher solar radiation levels, which make them ideal candidates for solar farm installation. These areas should be prioritized for future installations.
•	Effect of Ambient Temperature:
The analysis of ambient temperature shows that the regions of interest have moderate temperature ranges. However, temperatures that exceed certain thresholds could negatively affect solar panel performance, and this should be considered when selecting installation sites.
•	Wind Speed and Cleaning Operations:
Wind speed, although generally low, shows some variation, particularly in Sierra Leone and Togo. Higher gusts in these regions could influence the cleaning frequency of the solar panels, which may affect the operational costs and efficiency of solar farms.
•	Environmental Conditions:
Humidity and precipitation levels in the data showed potential impact on solar panel soiling. Higher humidity levels can lead to increased soiling, which would require more frequent cleaning of the solar panels.

5. Recommendations for MoonLight Energy Solutions
•	High-Potential Regions:
Based on the solar radiation data (GHI and DNI), regions with consistently high values of these parameters should be prioritized for solar farm development. These are likely to be areas with more direct sunlight and fewer obstructions.
•	Temperature Control:
While ambient temperatures in these regions are relatively moderate, continuous monitoring should be conducted to ensure that high temperatures do not affect solar panel efficiency. Solar farms should also be designed to mitigate thermal losses.
•	Wind Speed Considerations:
Wind speed does not appear to be a significant challenge in most regions. However, for areas with high gusts, the frequency of solar panel cleaning might need to be adjusted to maintain efficiency.
•	Sustainability and Maintenance:
Regular cleaning cycles will be important to optimize solar farm performance. Areas with high humidity or precipitation might require more frequent maintenance of the solar panels.

6. Conclusion
This analysis of solar radiation measurement data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo has provided key insights into the environmental factors that influence solar farm efficiency. The data suggests that there are multiple high-potential regions within these countries for solar energy generation. By focusing on these areas and addressing environmental factors like temperature, wind speed, and soiling, MoonLight Energy Solutions can make data-driven decisions to enhance the operational efficiency and sustainability of its solar investments.
